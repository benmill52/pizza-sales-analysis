- Large, medium, and small pizzas dominate sales, while XL and XXL sell very little.  
- Top 5 pizzas account for a significant portion of total sales.  
- Sales peak at lunch (12–14 hours) and dinner (16–20 hours).  
- July, May, and March are the strongest sales months.

## Conclusion

This analysis provided valuable insights into pizza sales performance. From the findings:

Customer demand peaks during lunch (12–14h) and dinner (18–20h), suggesting the best times for promotions and staff scheduling.

Top-selling pizzas such as The Classic Deluxe and Barbecue Chicken dominate revenue, showing the importance of keeping these well-stocked.

Underperforming pizzas generate little revenue and may be reconsidered or rebranded.

Size and pricing play a role in sales, with medium and large pizzas selling more consistently than extra-large.

Seasonal and monthly trends indicate potential opportunities for targeted campaigns during high-demand periods.

Overall, this project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support better business decisions — from menu optimization to staffing and marketing strategies.
